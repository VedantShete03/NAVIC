# NAVIC

This repository contains code for integrating NAVIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation) into the GNSS SDR (Software-Defined Radio) library. NAVIC is India's regional satellite navigation system, similar to GPS.

## Introduction

The GNSS SDR library is a software satellite receiver that supports various global navigation satellite systems, including GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and now NAVIC. This integration allows developers to use NAVIC signals within the GNSS SDR framework for research, development, and testing purposes.

## Features

- **NAVIC Support:** Adds support for processing NAVIC signals alongside other GNSS signals.
- **Compatibility:** Compatible with existing GNSS SDR functionalities and workflows.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Easily configure and customize NAVIC processing parameters.
- **Documentation:** Includes documentation and examples for integrating NAVIC into GNSS SDR projects.
